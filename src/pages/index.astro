        Hello, I'm a Class of 2026 student at the University of Washington
        Seattle and a Software Engineer that's eager to try new things and loves
        logic puzzles.
        <br />
        My current interests include video games from my childhood like Minecraft,
        Skyrim, and Stardew Valley as ever since I was young, coming up with new
        ideas meant that I could bring them to life in these games through mods.
